1.  Introduction

   Many of the protocols that make up the Internet architecture were
   designed and first implemented in an envrionment of mutual trust
   among network engineers, operators, and users, on computers that were
   incapable of using cryptographic protocols to provide
   confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity for those protocols, in
   a legal environment where cryptographic technology was largely
   protected by restricted licensing and/or prohibited by law.  The
   result has been a protocol stack where security properties have been
   added to core protocols using those protocol's extension mechanisms.

   As extension mechanisms are by design optional features of a
   protocol, this has led to a situation where security is optional up
   and down the protocol stack.  Protocols with optional security have
   proven to be difficult to deploy.  This document describes and
   examines this problem, and provides guidance for future evolution of
   the protocol, based on current work in network measurement and usable
   security research.

2.  Problem statement

   Consider an optional security extension with the following
   properties:

   1.  The extension is optional: a given connection or operation will
       succeed without the extension, albeit without the security
       properties the extension guarantees.

   2.  The extension has a true positive probability P: the probability
       that it will cause any given operation to fail, thereby
       successfully preventing an attack that would have otherwise
       succeeded had the extension not been enabled.  This probability
       is a function of the extension's effectiveness as well as the

       probability that said operation will be an instance of the attack
       the extension prevents.

   3.  The extension has a false positive probability Q: the probability
       it will cause any given operation to fail due to some condition
       other than an attack, e.g. due to a misconfiguration.

   Moving from no deployment of an optional security extension to full
   deployment is a protocol transition as described in [RFC8170].  We
   posit that the implicit transition plans for these protocols have
   generally suffered from an underestimation of a disincentive (section
   5.2) linked to the relationship between P and Q for any given
   protocol.

   Specifically, if Q is much greater than P, then any user of an
   optional security extension will face an overwhelming incentive to
   disable that extension, as the cost of dealing with spuriously
   failing operations becomes greater than the cost of dealing with
   relatively rare successful attacks.  This incentive becomes stronger
   when the cause of the false positive is someone else's problem; i.e.
   not a misconfiguration the user can possibly fix.  This situation can
   arise when poor design, documentation, or tool support elevates the
   incidence of misconfiguration (high Q), in an environment where the
   attack models addressed by the extension are naturally rare (low P).

3.  Case studies

3.1.  DNSSEC

   [EDITOR'S NOTE: write me, cite IMC17 paper (and earlier work)
   measuring deployment.]

3.2.  BGPsec

   [EDITOR'S NOTE: find citations and write me.]

3.3.  HTTP over TLS

   [EDITOR'S NOTE: write me, this is so far a partial success story but
   has required coordinated effort up and down the stack.]

4.  Discussion and guidelines

   [EDITOR'S NOTE: write me. the inertia here is severe but can be
   mitigated. through external distortion of incentives; i.e. paying
   people to turn DNSSEC on seems to work, as does reducing the cost of
   certificates to zero and the effort (and therefore misconfiguration
   incidence Q) to epsilon. ]

   report about IP options written by Rodrigo Fonseca et al., via a
   paper at IMC 2017 by Brian Goodchild et al.
